# react-pokedex
A pokedex created with javascript and react using the pokeapi API
# Getting Started with Create React App


# Pokedex app created with javascript and React 

### A fully responsive pokedex created with javascript, react and antdesign. 

#### Features: 
- Displays a list of pokemons in gallery form
- Displays pokemon cards that allow you to preview basic information about each pokemon 
- Allows you to search for pokemons by their name from the home page 
- Allows you to filter pokemons by type, displaying a list of pokemons of the specific type 
- By clicking on a pokemon you will be redirected to a page where more detailed statistics of the pokemons are shown

I used react-router-dom to set up the routes and navigation of the application. I also imported some components from the antdesign library that allowed me to improve the functionality of the application, such as pagination, search inputs or the layout itself. 

The application was completely designed and developed by me for educational purposes as part of my learning process in the field of programming. 

## Objectives
#### The objectives proposed to be achieved with the realization of this app were:

- Learn data consumption from APIs
- Put into practice knowledge of react and componentization of applications with react
- Know what the folder structure is in a medium-sized development project
- Put into practice skills in html, css, JavaScript, responsive web design.
- Familiarize myself with the use of libraries such as antdesign to carry out more professional projects.

## Improvement 

Having created the application for educational purposes, I have no doubt that many implementations can be improved and done in different ways, one of my goals is to optimize its code as much as possible and thus continue learning.

The use of the application is open to anyone, as long as due recognition and mention is given to the author and it is not used for profit.
